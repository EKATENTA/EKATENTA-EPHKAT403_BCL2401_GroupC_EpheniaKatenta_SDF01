# Project Overview
I"ve created a landing page for our CodeSpace Cat.The page has navigation link ,headers, and many other
elements.I used image calling links/tags to be able to put in my images and used alt to let the image know the specific place it needs to be,
i also used &copy to put the copy rights .

The project goes to the landind page and shows a profile picture of our space cat, the list of skills the cat has and pictures of landing page thumbnail.
